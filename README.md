# Description

As part of a fictional expansion of Edinburgh Airport, I have been asked to assess whether the new baggage reclaim hall has sufficient capactity. The data is a simulation output that contains the number of bags on each belt as well as arrival and departure times of the individual passengers in the reclaim hall. 

In the analysis I answer the following questions:
1. Do the belts have suffucient capacity?
2. Are wait times acceptable?
3. What is the maximum number of passengers waiting simultaniously in the baggage reclaim hall?

The analysis is in the file capacity_analysis.ipynb and the results and recommendations are presented in the file findings.pdf.

The data files *bags.csv* and *passengers.csv* contain the simulation output.
