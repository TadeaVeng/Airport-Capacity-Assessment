# Description

As part of a fictional expansion of Edinburgh Airport, I have been asked to assess whether the new baggage reclaim hall has sufficient capactity. 

In the analysis I answer the following questions:
1. Do the belts have suffucient capacity?
2. Are wait times acceptable?
3. What is the maximum number of passengers waiting simultaniously in the baggage reclaim hall?

The analysis is in the file capacity_analysis.ipynb and the results and recommendations are presented in the file findings.pdf.

The data files are the output of a simulation. The first one *bags.csv* contains the number of bags on each belt while the second file *passengers.csv* contain the arrival and departure times of the individual passengers in the reclaim hall. A more detailed description of the data is given in both the capacity_analysis.ipynb and findings.pdf files.
